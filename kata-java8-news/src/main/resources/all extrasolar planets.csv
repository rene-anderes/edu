PSR J1719-1438 b;PSR 1719-1438;The 5.7ms pulsar PSR J1719-14 shows timing variations on a 2.17 hour timescale. These can be explained with a Jovian planet.

NY Virginis (AB) b;N/A;The rapidly pulsating eclipsing binary NY Virginis has a period of 0.1 days. On a much longer timescale of 7.9 years, the system exhibits small amplitude cyclic variations which are associated with a third body in the system. A recent paper by Qian et. al. claims that this body is a giant circumbinary planet orbiting NY Vir at a distance of 3.3 astronomical units. There might be another planet in this system with an even longer orbital period, probably more than 15 years.

MOA-bin-1 b;MOA-bin-1;This planet has been discovered in data from the 2006-2007 MOA project by Bennett et al (2012). It is the first planetary event in which the stellar host is only detected through binary microlensing events. Note that the discovery paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.
MOA-2013-BLG-220L b;MOA-2013-BLG-220L;MOA-2013-BLG-220L is a microlensing event observed in 2013. The most likely candidate for the lens system is a planet orbiting a brown dwarf host star. Many of the parameters are uncertain and followup observations are required to further constrain the system. Observations will become possible in 2021 when the lens and source will have separated sufficiently to be resolved in high resolution images.

Kepler-22 b;Kepler-22;The planet Kepler-22b has been discovered with the Kepler spacecraft. It is orbiting the solar type Kepler target star KIC10593626. This puts it in the habitable zone with an equilibrium temperature of minus 11 degrees Celsius (plus 11 degrees Fahrenheit). If the planet has an atmosphere similar to that of Earth then the surface temperature is 22 degrees Celsius (71 degrees Fahrenheit). Kepler-22b is the smallest radius planet known to orbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the Sun.
Kepler-21 b;Kepler-21;This planet has been discovered with the Kepler spacecraft. It is orbiting Kepler's brightest host star and is only 1.6 times larger than the Earth.
Kepler-20 f;Kepler-20;The Kepler-20 system hosts at least 5 transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 f is orbiting the star every 20 days and has a size similar to that of Earth. It is too close to the star to be habitable. However, it could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.
Kepler-20 e;Kepler-20;The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 e is most likely a rocky planet made of iron and silicates. It is approximately the size of Venus and is the first discovery of a sub-Earth size planet by the Kepler team. It is not habitable because the planet is on an orbit very close to its host star and the equilibrium temperature is as high as 1000 Kelvin (726C, 1340F).
Kepler-20 d;Kepler-20;The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 d has a low mean density and cannot be composed of rocky and iron material alone. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 95C (205F).
Kepler-20 c;Kepler-20;The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 c has a low mean density which means it cannot be composed of rocky and iron material alone but must have a gas envelope.
Kepler-20 b;Kepler-20;The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 b has a period of only 3.7 days. Because it is about twice as big as the Earth, it is classified as a super-Earth or sub-Neptune. Kepler-20 b's composition is ambiguous. It could be a terrestrial planet with a rocky surface or it could have a significant gas envelope.
Kepler-19 c;Kepler-19;The planet Kepler-19 c was the first confirmed detection of a planet by transit timing variations.

Kepler-17 b;Kepler-17;Kepler-17b is a planet on a short orbit around a solar mass star. One year on this planet equals 1.5 days on Earth. Star spots on the host star constrain the eccentricity and obliquity of the planet.
Kepler-16 (AB) b;N/A;Kepler-16 (AB) b is a circum-binary planet. It is orbiting two stars. The orbit of the binary stars and the planet are perfectly alligned within half a degree. This suggests that the planet formed in a circumbinary disc.
Kepler-15 b;Kepler-15;Kepler-15b is a planet discovered by NASA's Kepler mission and confirmed by the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The density of the planet is high, suggesting an enrichment in heavy elements.

Kepler-10 c;Kepler-10;This planet was confirmed using infrared observations from Spitzer. It is highly unlikely (0.002%) that Kepler-10 c is a false positive.

Alpha Centauri B b;Alpha Centauri B;Alpha Centauri is one of the brightest stars in the southern sky (in fact, it is a triple system). European astronomers have discovered a planet with about the mass of the Earth orbiting Alpha Centauri B. It is the nearest exoplanet to Earth and also the lightest exoplanet ever discovered around a Sun-like star. The planet was detected using the HARPS instrument on the 3.6-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. The planet is currently labelled as controversial as no consensus on its status has been reached in the literature yet.

14 Her b;14 Her;The star 14 Herculis is only 59 light years away in the constellation Hercules. However, because it is an orange dwarf star it can not be seen with the naked eye. There is only one confirmed planet in the system, but a dynamical analysis suggests that they might be two planets locked in a 4:1 mean motion resonance.

1SWASP J1407 b;1SWASP J1407;The light curve of 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 underwent a complex series of deep eclipses that lasted 56 days in April 2007. This light curve is interpreted as the transit of a giant ring system that is filling up a fraction of the Hill sphere of an unseen secondary companion, J1407b. The object is currently listed as controversial as various inconsistencies arise in current models and it is not clear that the object really is a planet.
1RXS1609 b;1RXS1609;1RXS J160929.1-210524 is a 5 million year old pre-main sequence star in the constellation of Scorpius. The observed planet has a large separation, posing problems for current formation scenarios. Two possibilities are that the planet formed by gravitational instability or migrated outwards.
